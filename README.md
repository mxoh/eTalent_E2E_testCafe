This E2E Test suites for eTalente Login page (https://etalente.co.za), using TestCafe framework.
The features is for a failed login to the eTalente.

After using the two frameworks and I recommend TestCafe framework based on these reasons.
Fast -: Browser is controlled from inside a web page. This makes test run inside a browser as fast as your browser can render page with no extra network requests.

Simple Cross-Browser Support -: Because TestCafe only launches browsers, it can automate browser on desktop or mobile. Unlike WebDriver, you don't need special version of browser and driver to prepare to run tests. Setup simplified. All you need is just a browser installed, and you are ready to go.

Stable to Execution -: Because a test is executed inside a browser, the network latency effects are reduced. Unlike WebDriver you won't hit stale element exceptions, or element not interactable exceptions, as from within a web browser all DOM elements are accessible.
